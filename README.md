Voice Activated Desk Lamp.
Have you every gone to bed after a long day of homework and realized your desk lamp is on? Well, me too. After one night of this, I needed to change something. Now, with this project, I can command my favourite desk lamp to turn off by saying "Turn off" or "Light off". Saving me the walk to flip a switch.
